      <h2>ðŸŒŸ Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        "Welcome to my digital portfolio â€” a space where dreams meet purpose. My name is Olivier, and I come from Rwanda, a land full of potential and resilient communities. As a young African driven by innovation, I believe that we can solve our own challenges using local talent, smart thinking, and bold ideas.
        <br><br>
        This website is more than just a school project. It's the beginning of a lifelong mission to build impactful solutions using technology. Starting with healthcare drone delivery, my goal is to help Africa save more lives, create more jobs, and inspire more young minds.
        <br><br>
        Explore this platform to see how Iâ€™m using reflective thinking, entrepreneurial action, and future-focused design to build something meaningful for my community and continent."

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Olivier, a young visionary from Rwanda with a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. I study at African Leadership University (ALU) and in Data Science at Alt School Africa. Growing up in communities where people face challenges accessing quick healthcare, I became motivated to change that. I believe Africa has the talent and potential to build our own solutions. Thatâ€™s why I chose to focus on healthcare drones â€“ not just for delivery, but to build systems that are owned, run, and improved by Africans for Africa.

    <div class="inline-box mission-box">
      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        My mission is to use drone and smart technology to improve how healthcare is delivered across Africa, especially in remote areas. I want to help doctors and nurses get critical supplies like medicine, vaccines, and emergency tools faster. This way, we can save lives, create local jobs, and inspire young people to use technology to solve real problems.

      </div>
      <h2>Entrepreneurial Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My journey started by observing rural challenges in healthcare. I noticed long waits & extensive travels for treatment, which led me to research and eventually pursue a healthcare drone delivery solution.

      </div>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m developing a smart drone system to deliver essential healthcare items quickly â€“ from medicines and vaccines to diagnostic samples and emergency kits.

      </div>
      <h2>Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        Working with online tools and simulations, I am crafting a drone model and developing software to manage efficient delivery routes for critical healthcare supplies.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Although this project remains in its conceptual stages, it has already inspired me to explore how simple ideas can drive innovation. As a student at African Leadership University, I am continuously learning and building the foundations of this solution. I am committed to refining and realizing this project over the next three to five years as I work to connect technology with the ever-evolving needs of our communities.
